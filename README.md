# Krill Herd Algorithm Visualisation ü¶ê

This project demonstrates the **Krill Herd (KH) algorithm**, a bio-inspired optimisation technique that simulates the herding behavior of krill in nature. Each krill moves through the search space influenced by:

- **Social interaction** (cohesion with the swarm),
- **Attraction to a target**, and
- **Random foraging** (simulating natural exploration).

The animation visualises how the swarm of krill collectively searches for and converges on target positions over time. Once all krill reach the current target, a new one is generated dynamically.

**Disclaimer:** Parts of this code and documentation were generated with the assistance of ChatGPT to accelerate development and improve clarity. AI assistance was used to help implement standard algorithms, handle plotting and animation, and structure explanations effectively.
